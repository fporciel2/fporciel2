# Hello, I'm fporciel! 👋

## 📚 About Me

I'm a student at [42 Roma](https://www.42roma.it/), deeply passionate about blending the fields of programming, philosophy, psychology, and mathematics.
My journey in coding started at School 42 in January 2023, where I embraced the challenge of learning through a unique, peer-to-peer learning environment. 
My quest for knowledge is driven by a desire to understand the Universe at a theoretical level and to apply this understanding in practical, humanitarian ways.

## 💻 Tech & Interests

- **Languages & Technologies:** Proficient at elementary level in C language, competent at an elementary level in C and Bash, which I am learning through the GNU and 42 standards.
                                I am interested in expanding my skills to other languages, once I consolidate my knowledge of C, C++ and Bash.
                                In particular, I am interested in Rust, Lisp and Cobol.
  
- **FLOSS Advocacy:** Committed to contributing to Free/Libre and Open Source Software.
                      I deeply agree with the idea that Free/Libre Open Source software is the key to the entry of computer science into a universal and rigorous programming paradigm,
                       and that the gradual commitment to free software and its global adoption, especially in the public context, is an enlightened digitalization project.
  
- **Current Project:** I am currently completing the main course of school 42.
                        I'm about to start other supplementary side projects.
                        Based on my learning journey, I started working on a C language library.
  
- **Interdisciplinary Approach:** I try to integrate principles of philosophy, psychology, and mathematics into my programming projects, seeking to uncover how these disciplines intersect with technology.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

- Advanced concepts in theoretical computer science to deepen my understanding of the foundations of programming.
- The Debian Universal Operating System, aiming to contribute to its development and wider adoption.
- Further exploring the philosophical underpinnings of technology and its impact on society.

## 🤝 How to collaborate

I'm open to collaborating on projects aimed at FLOSS improvement, developing tools for public use, and applying technology for humanitarian purposes. 
If you're interested in working together or have a project in mind that aligns with my interests, feel free to reach out!
